# CSC207-WhatEver-46

## Software Specifications
The program should be able to make correlations between data and extrapolation of new data using existing data. Specific data sets used by the program will (probably may) include US stock prices, the S&P 500, US overall economic data. Users will be allowed to display raw and extrapolated data in at least one graphical form, a tabular form, and a computer-calculated predictive model form.

## Tasks
We want to implement the outer layer of the program before moving onto the use cases, so we will delegate tasks for each of:
1. Main (Charles)
2. Creation of GraphicalView and TabularView (Andy)
3. APIAccessObject (Winston)
4. Stock (Trevor)
5. StockPrice (Amanda)

Start date: Oct 23, 2023
